            <p>The Koenigsegg Agera is a mid-engine sports car produced by Swedish car manufacturer Koenigsegg.
                It is a successor to the CCX/CCXR. The name comes from the Swedish verb 'agera' which means 
                "to act" or in imperative form "(You) act!".
                It was named Hypercar of the Year in 2010 by Top Gear magazine. The Agera RS variant became 
                the world's fastest production car in 2017, setting a record with a GPS-verified two-way 
                average top speed of 447 km/h (278 mph) and a fastest straight-line speed of 458 km/h (285 mph)
