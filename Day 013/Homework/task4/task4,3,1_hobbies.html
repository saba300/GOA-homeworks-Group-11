        <h1>Programming</h1>
        <p>I was interested in programing since 4th grade. When I was in 5th grade I started learning programing in Mziuri.
        I was learning it in Mziuri for 3 years. At first year I was studying Pascal. At second and thierd year I was studying c++,
        But I didn`t liked their studying methods at thierd year so I quit form mziuri and continue learning at komarovi.
        But when I was studying programming at koomarovi there was only 3 or 4 students at lessons and lessons where so boring,
        which made me little lazy and I quit. Then I started learning at GOA and I really like it and still enjoying writing codes
        and doing projects.
